This is a simple **Windows** GUI to help you uploading multiple Steam apps through **Steams Content Builder** tool.

It is made for **Game Developers** that regularly need to upload **multiple apps** (with different app IDs) to **Steam**.

If you have multiple games and/or games with demos you know why this tool exists ü§ê!

Spend less time ‚è± uploading things, have more time for game development! üéÆ

## How to use this tool
### Preparation
- Of course you need to be a Steam partner and have your game(s) setup inside the Steam partner web interface.
- If you haven't already, follow the steps in **[this official manual](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading?l=finnish&language=english#1)**.
- Setup your `vdf` files as needed - I personally use the **SteamPipe GUI Tool**. A guide is **[available here](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk/uploading?l=finnish&language=english#3)**.
- Make sure the `vdf` file are in `tools\ContentBuilder\scripts` in your steamworks sdk folder.
- Download the latest **Steam Upload GUI** from the **[releases](https://github.com/RPicster/Steam-Upload-GUI/releases)** or export it yourself using Godot.
- Unzip the executable and place it in some nice place (There will be two files created... so not on Desktop üòú).
### Using the GUI ‚ú®
- Start `SteamUploadGUI.exe` and first, enter your path to the `\ContentBuilder` directory e.g. `"C:\steam_sdk\tools\ContentBuilder`.
- After pressing `Enter` to confirm, it automatically detects your Steam apps `vdf` files.
- Select the Apps that you want to Upload.
- Enter your Steam credentials for the upload (Steam suggests to create a special user for that, I would recommend following that guideline! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
- If it is your first time uploading Apps via the Content Builder, you probably need to **authenticate via Steam Guard** first. Use the button on the bottom to do so.
- When the tool is interacting with `steamcmd.exe` a new comnmand prompt will open to show you the progress.

## Troubleshooting
**‚ùì Problem:** I can not find any Apps!</br>
**‚ùó Solution:** Make sure you followed the above steps! Check if there are `*.vdf` files for your projects in the `ContentBuilder\scripts` folder.

**‚ùì Problem:** The uploaded version is not live on Steam!</br>
**‚ùó Solution:** If an app is uploaded via the Content Builder, you always have to set it to the `default` branch manually in the web interface, there is no way to upload something and set if life on `default` automatically.
